    <h1>Why?</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>One of my favorite ways to maintain and practice the languages I've learned is through answering random questions from a question generator or writing a journal entry about my day/week/whatever. This app serves as a space for just that!
      There is a word bank feature that allows users to jot down words they wanted to use in their entry but did not know how to say it in their target language so they can review those words later.

  <div class="right">
    <p> This was my first time working with databases ever, and my first time integrating APIs in Swift. It was an incredibly fulfilling learning opportunity!

    <h1>Future</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>I'm currently working on creating folders that are seperated by language to store the journal entries and a way for users to track their progress.</p>
