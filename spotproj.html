      <p>Solo project</p>
      <p>Tools: ReactJS, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Spotify API</p>
      <p>This is a multiplayer game that presents users with a randomized prompt and challenges them to create a playlist following the prompt under a self-selected time. Once time is up, they are able to see each others playlists.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="right">
