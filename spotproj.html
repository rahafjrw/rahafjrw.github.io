      <h1>Why?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p>My friends and I love making random playlists and playlists for each other. I thought it would be fun to gameify it!</p>

      <h1>Challenges</h1>
    </div>  
    <div class="right">
      <p>When I search for the first track, the page refreshes, so that's something I'm currently debugging. Overall, it was fun and smooth learning about API's through this project!</p>

      <h1>Future</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
      <p>I want to add a timer feature that creates the playlist once time is up. It would also be cool to incorporate some kind of multiplayer feature, where players make playlists seperately, then in the end see one anothers.
        I'm still working on the design of the multiplayer aspect given that it will interact with API's, and I'm new to working with APIs. There are so many features I want to add to this project, and I'm excited to see it grow!
